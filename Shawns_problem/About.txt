Apologies for not being dull but I don’t know who else to turn to. AI isn’t helping. And it’s doing my head in.
This is my 10yr olds math homework.
Each square needs to contain a single number (1-12 inclusive with each number only being used once) with each row and column adding up to 25. Any mathematicians out there that can help me, I mean my son?
Update: Thanks for everyone’s input! I’ll send a merit certificate to everyone who solved it for him.
1, the centre, larger square isn’t included. I should have somehow worded that in my description.
2, Yes, I tried various AI apps, none could work it out before I gave up.
3, I drew the squares in the notes app, my phone is on dark mode but when I sent the note it turned it white. I too hate a white background.
4, This was a bonus, non compulsory question in his homework.
5, yes my son should be doing his own homework. But when it was clear this was way above his level, I took on the challenge.
Thanks for playing along!
