### ecpw
EC Pass Word - The easy way to keep your secrets out of your source code.

## Easy
ecpw is ridiculously easy to use. Look in ecpw_demo.py to see how.

## Safe
ecpw is safer than most alternatives. The safety arise solely from keeping the
.ecpw file to your self. It's by default located in your home directory, and is
called .ecpw. So unless you synchronise you entire home directory to Dropbox,
you're properly quite safe.
