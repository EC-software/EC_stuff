### ecpw
EC Pass Word - The easy way to keep your secrets out of your source code.

## Easy
ecpw became popular, because it's ridiculously easy to use.

## Safe
ecpw is safer than most alternatives. The safety is in keeping the .ecpw file to your self.
It's by default located in your home directory, and is called .ecpw.
So unless you synchronise you entire home directory to Dropbox, you're properly quite safe.
