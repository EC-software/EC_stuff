### ecpw
EC Pass Word - The easy way to keep your secrets out of your source code.

## Easy
Ecpw is ridiculously easy to use. Look at ecpw_demo.py to see how.

## Safe
Ecpw is safer than most alternatives. The safety arises solely from keeping the
.ecpw file to yourself. It's by default located in your home directory, and is
called .ecpw. So unless you synchronise your entire home directory to Dropbox,
you're properly quite safe.
